# Bipartite if and only if Bicolorable

## A small bit of theory
Testing if a Graph is Bicolorable is equivalent to testing if it's Bipartite. Take a time to read some of the references below (simple references, like Wikipedia).

## BFS vs DFS
Probably, it's a matter of preference. Sure there is the built-in difference between **BFS** vs **DFS**, but for these problems, it doesn't really matter. Read, understand and give a try on both implementations.

## Problems

Please, do not just copy and paste any code. They're small enough to type.

## Purpose of these snippets
These snippets are some possible implementations of solutions for the **Bicoloring Problem**. They're here just because they're small and self-contained algorithms, and can improve your understanding about DFS and BFS.
